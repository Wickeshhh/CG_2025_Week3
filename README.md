# Week 3: OOP Design & Linked List Implementation

Welcome to the repository for **Week 3** of our Java learning journey. This week advanced our understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through real-world use cases and introduced one of the most important data structures ‚Äî the Linked List.

## ‚úÖ Topics Covered

### [Day 1: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interface and Abstract Class](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week3/tree/master/Day1-Encapsulation%2C%20Polymorphism%2C%20Interface%20and%20Abstract%20Class)
- Implemented practical Java programs using:
  - **Encapsulation** to hide class internals
  - **Polymorphism** for dynamic method dispatch
  - **Interfaces** to enforce structure
  - **Abstract classes** for reusable blueprints
- Modeled real systems like:
  - Hospital Management
  - Library System
  - Ride Hailing
  - Vehicle Rental

### [Day 2: Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Interface and Abstract Class (Continued)](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week3/tree/master/Day2-Encapsulation%2C%20Polymorphism%2C%20Interface%20and%20Abstract%20Class)
- Continued implementation of OOP concepts
- Focused on:
  - Interface-based system design
  - Comparing abstract classes vs interfaces
  - Enhancing code reusability and modularity

### [Day 3: Linked List Basics](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week3/tree/master/Day3-Linked%20List)
- Introduced Linked List data structure
- Topics included:
  - Creating Node and LinkedList classes
  - Inserting nodes at head and tail
  - Traversing the list
  - Understanding node references

### [Day 4: Linked List Operations](https://github.com/Wickeshhh/Week3/tree/master/Day4-Linked%20List)
- Implemented advanced operations on linked lists
  - Insertion at specific positions
  - Deletion (by position and by value)
  - Searching and updating values
  - Reversing a linked list
- Developed interactive, menu-driven programs for practice
